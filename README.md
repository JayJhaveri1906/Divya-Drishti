The Objective of this system is to help/guide the
visually challenged people with the help of a smart device using
an Android Phone. This device will help the visually challenged
person to get greater sense of awareness of surroundings
around him/her and will also help him/her by protecting them
against frauds. What makes this device innovative is that the
device is completely Internet Free and also helps in effective
communication with the help of Voice Commands as this is the
only medium through which a visually challenged person can
effectively communicate with an external device. Our device
has successfully managed to implement multiple daily usage
features like OCR, Bill Reading, Text Summarization, Mask
